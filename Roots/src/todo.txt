Things to do:
1) Find seed (idea - when many roots come together and touch the same blob,
	that is the seed).
2) Horizontal roots - do not detect well, try to fix this.
3) Remove small roots - some roots are very small (<5 voxels), explore why
4) Begin coding traits to extract from each root
5) Experiment & Ground truth
